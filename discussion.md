# Discussion In-Class Exercise

## Purpose
The purpose of this semester-long exercise is to allow students to demonstrate and articulate key concepts in Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing (MUC) through presentation-style deliverables. In completing these sub-tasks, the students will absorb class material and reading through all four major learning styles: visual learning, auditory learning, tactile learning, and learning by reading and/or writing.

## Overview
Throughout the semester, students will brainstorm, improve, and deliberate over a variety of wearable designs through the context of course material. Ideas like privacy, summative testing, and formative testing will be explored through the lens of real-world ideation and application.

Students will be split into groups for the duration for the semester. In these groups, students will discuss their ideas for each task. With each learning model, the teams will iterate on their designs from the prior week to incrementally incorporate ideas shared from the current week. Classmates will witness the design process and application perspective of different wearables via quick peer presentations.

## Outcomes
In participating in discussion-style exercises, students will:
- Discuss with team members how to approach the problem at hand (auditory learning + collaborative learning),
- Map mental concepts to visual designs (visual learning),
- Create a presentation slide (tactile learning), and
- Share their ideas with the class (feedback)

By the end of the semester, students will:
- Have an idea crafted by course learnings. 
- Have used critical thinking to creatively apply abstract concepts to real-world applications.
- Have articulated their ideas to the class through presentation-style discussions.
- Have had exposure to multiple applications of MUC beyond a single type of device.

## Instructions
Before proceeding, students should be split into groups of three or four. Each group will be assigned a ubiquitous computing problem to “solve” by creating a device. Problem prompts should be relatively broad to allow students to brainstorm potential existing problems and how to solve them. With each learning module, students will iterate on their solution by incorporating information about privacy, testing, gestures, and more. 

### Example Problems to Assign:
- Create a device to better support elderly individuals in a home.
- Create a device to better support blind individuals.
- Create a device to better support deaf individuals.
- Create a device to better support mute individuals.
- Create a device to store, retrieve, and transmit information in wearable form.
- Create a device to better support business communication across a large company.

## Discussion Topics (~15min deliberations)

### Topic 1: Design Ideation
- **Purpose:** Expand the creativity of students by encouraging them to use limited resources to visualize complex systems.
- **Prompt:** Suppose it is the year 2010 and you’ve decided to solve your assigned group problem by creating a never-seen-before wearable device. How would you create the device keeping in mind privacy, heat, networking, and interface?

<br>

### Topic 2: Privacy
- **Purpose:** Encourage students to delve deeper into Langheinrich principles through application.
- **Prompt:** Consider the ways in which your wearable violates privacy. Keep in mind topics discussed in this week’s lecture. In your presentation this week, include the ways your device violates privacy and, for each Langheinrich principle, include at least 1 way to improve your initial design.


<br>

### Topic 3: Formative Testing
- **Purpose:** Explore device testing within problem scope. 
- **Prompt:** Consider the ways in which you would conduct a formative study for your new device. Generate at least 2 proposals and answer the questions:
    - What kind of information would you capture?
    - How would you conduct your study?
    - Who would your audience be?
    - How many participants would you invite? 
    - How would the results from your study better inform your direction? 


<br>

### Topic 4: Summative Testing
- **Purpose:** Explore device testing within problem scope. 
- **Prompt:** Consider the ways in which you would conduct a summative study for your new device. Generate at least 2 proposals and answer the questions:
    - What kind of information would you capture?
    - How would you conduct your study?
    - Who would your audience be?
    - How many participants would you invite? 
    - How would the results from your study better inform your direction? 

<br>

### Topic 5: Gestures
- **Purpose:** Introduce gestures into device design and reflect on its usefulness and how to improve its inclusion.
- **Prompt:** How might your device incorporate gestures in its interface? (If you do not think it would be beneficial for your current design, think of ways to reformat your design to allow for gestures.)
<br>Then, create 5 gestures for your device and support your gesture choices. In other words, what makes your gestures more intuitive over other options?

<br>

============================================================================

## Deliverable (~5min presentation /  group)
After discussing each topic, discussion groups are expected to create a PowerPoint slide detailing their updates/additions to their device design and present their deliberations and justifications to the whole class. Students will be evaluated on their ability to apply flipped classroom lectures and readings to their design iterations.
