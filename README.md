# MUC Exercises
 
## [Semester-Long Discussion and Design Exercise](discussion.md)
Students have a series of pen-and-paper design discussions and class presentation over the course of the semester based on topics introduced in flipped classroom lectures and assigned readings. 

## [Eye-Typing](eye-typing.md)
Students experiment with the usability of eye-based interaction through a wizard-of-oz style test.  There are three parts to the exercise that each attempt to teach about the difficulties of eye typing as well as introduce students to the NASA TLX scale.

## [Gestural Interfaces](gestures.md)
Students design and test gestural interfaces. Includes two variations on the theme - one version where the students design their own gestures and test them with a partner in a wizard-of-oz test, and one where students use Google's Teachable Machine to implement a partial sign language recognizer.

## [Head Mounted Displays](hmd.md)
Students experiment with optimal placement and eyebox for a head mounted display system.
